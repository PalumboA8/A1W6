   <h1 style=text-align:center; font-family: Arial;"> Evaluation of Arlington's Center for Local History </h1>
   <h2> System Introduction </h2>
    <p1> A part of <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/">Arlington Public Library</a> , The Center for Local History (CLH) serves the Arlington community by preserving the County's cultural and historical heritage. It's stated mission is,"The Charlie Clark Center for Local History (CCCLH) collects, preserves, and shares resources that illustrate Arlington Countyâ€™s history, diversity and communities.Librarians and archivists develop collections of unique research material and make them available for use by residents, students, teachers, genealogists, scholars, authors, journalists and anyone interested in learning more about Arlington County." The Center for Local History's website is organized within the main Arlington County Public Library (ACPL) website. </p1>
    <br>
    <p2> The main users of this system are local historians, interested citizens, authors, elected officals, and genealogists.  </p2>
    <br>
    <p3> The CLH website allows users to search both archival materials and regular books held by the ACPL. This includes the entire library collection of material including books, movies, games, and other materials lended by the library. This includes basic identifiying information such as title, author, and publication date. Most valuably however, is the ability to search the digital collections of the archives and special collections held by the CLH.  Archival material often includes journals, local history books, financial records, and subject files on important topics to Arlington's history. Users can see any metadata that has been publicly posted along with the digitized material; including a title, creator, date, or other accompanying information. Users can designate their searches between the catalog, the entire library site, and events calendar.  </p3>
    <br>
   <h2> Discussion </h2>
    <p4> Unique features: This database is interesting because of it's merger between the ACPL and CLH databases. While most archives have a seperate designated database that is often underfunded or underutilized, the CLH has bypassed those problems by being under the ACPL umbrella. This allows for better behind the scenes support than a typical standalone archives that does all the work themselves. </p4> 
    <br>
    <p5> Pros: </p5>
     <ul>
      <li> It can allow a wide variety of users to access a unique set of information related to local history. </li>
      <li> Easy to learn and accessible for patrons as it was integrated into existing library collections systems. </li>
     </ul>
    <p6> Cons: </p6>
     <ul>
      <li> It does not show archival collections that are unprocessed or in progress. </li>
      <li> The integrated system can sometimes confuse patrons. </li>
      <li> Users are not able to check out material and must work supervised in CLH reading room.
     </ul>
    <br>
    <p6> Suggestions: To improve this service, I would slightly seperate the CLH and ACPL catalogs. There should be an option in the search to designate between the two repositories. However, as most people are unaware that the CLH even exists, it would be best to keep both automatically checked for easy use. Users could then manually disable one or the other for a more refined search.  </p6>
